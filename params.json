{"name":"Menubarfilter","tagline":"iOS-like dark menu bar for OSX","body":"# A Dark Menu Bar for OS/X\r\n\r\nThis is a little app that turns your menu bar black.  It is derived from\r\nan application called Nocturne, by Blacktree, except that this version\r\nis focused primarily on the menu bar and not on the overall screen\r\ntinting that was present in Nocturne.\r\n\r\nIt also has improved behavior in the presence of Lion full-screen\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nAn overlay window is created that sits in front of the menu bar and\r\napplies a filters to change the menubar color.\r\n\r\nBy default it uses a hue filter to change the color, but there is a\r\nhidden preference that can be used to change this to a saturation filter\r\nin case you don't like how the colors are manipulated by the hue filter.\r\n\r\n## Preferences\r\n\r\nThere is no preference GUI (pull requests to add this are welcome!) but\r\nyou can set the following preferences via the command line:\r\n\r\n### Enable/Disable Menu Bar Item\r\n\r\nBy default, MenuBarFilter provides a menu item that allows you to quit\r\nit.  You can turn this off by running the following command and then\r\nrestarting MenuBarFilter:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ndefaults write org.wezfurlong.MenuBarFilter enableMenu NO\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Enable/Disable Hue Filter\r\n\r\nBy default, MenuBarFilter uses a Hue filter to manipulate the color of\r\nthe menu bar.  This may cause some menu bar apps to display with strange\r\ncolors (particularly those that use colored icons or graphs in the menu\r\nbar).  If you don't like this, you can disable the hue filter and\r\ninstead use a saturation filter to reduce the saturation, brightness and\r\ncontrast of the menu bar.\r\n\r\nYou will need to restart MenuBarFilter for this to take effect:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ndefaults write org.wezfurlong.MenuBarFilter useHue NO\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis software is distributed under the terms of the\r\n[Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n\r\n* Copyright 2005 Blacktree\r\n* Copyright 2011 eece\r\n* Copyright 2012 Wez Furlong\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-1250469-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
